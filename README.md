# Always-take-the-weather-with-you

## Description 

I created a weather application using HTML, CSS and javascript. The application makes use of the open weather map API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to give various information on
locations based on user input.

## Issues 

Currently the application displays the correct data for the 5 day forecast but on the date it increments one, two, three, four and five to the end of the year rather than the day(see screenshot). This is a minor
issue which would be a priority for future deveopment. This could probably be fixed fairly easily through use of moment.js. Despite this the data rendered is accurate.

## Features

The application gives comprehensive weather data for the user's chosen city both at the current time and for the following 5 days. Data rendered includes temperature, wind speeds, humidity and UV.

The application also utilises local storage to allow a user to click on a previously searched city in the sidebar and re-render the weather data for the chosen city to the page.

## Credits

Thanks goes to Open Weather API as without their free and excellent API the creation of this application would not have been possible.
